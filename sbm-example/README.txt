This folder contains some simulation examples and utilities for spin-boson models.

Models:

single-*: Test model with only one single mode;
debye1-*: Model with Debye spectral density; \eta=0.25, \omega_c=0.5, T=1.0, number of modes = 100;

Utilities:

gensbm.py: Generate spin boson model with given parameters.
runsbm.cmd, runsbm.sh: Run spin boson model using Ehrenfest dynamics with given filename prefix, step and timestep.
